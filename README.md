TODO App Exercise
In this exercise, you will create a To-Do list application with the following features:

view existing todo items
add new todo items
edit an existing todo item
delete a todo item
mark a todo item as done/completed
Components of the System
Frontend: displays the UI
Backend: processes requests from the Frontend and interfaces with the database
Database: persists storage
The Tech Stack
There are many, many ways to do this kind of project. Since this is a beginner project, we're going to keep it relatively simple.

Build the Frontend in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Build the Backend in NodeJS using Fastify

Use PostgreSQL as the database

Use docker and docker-compose to separate the infrastructure and enhance portability for deployment and other developers

Use a monorepo for this project

Basic Outline of How to Begin
create a project folder

add README and LICENSE files

create folders for the Frontend, Backend, and Database Components

add .gitkeep files to each of the component folders

initialize a repository and make an initial commit

put the repo on github and push it

create a frontend/src folder to contain the main source code files

config and environment files don't go in src

in frontend/src, create your initial layout with the following:

a list of todos already in the system

a form for adding new todo items

for now, just use dummy todo items while you get your layout right
add css and style the frontend

by the time that's done, I'll add more things here...
